//Combat Step by Step
//1.Determine surprise. The DM determines whether anyone
//involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
//2.Establish positions. The DM decides where all the
//characters and monsters are located. Given the
//adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in
//the room or other location, the DM figures out where the
//adversaries are—how far away and in what direction.
//3.Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter
//rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.
//4.Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in
//initiative order.
//5.Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the
//combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until
//the fighting stops.
